# AI-vs-Human-Text
This project develops a machine learning model to differentiate between text generated by humans and text generated by AI. Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and TensorFlow/Keras for model building, it offers insights into distinguishing characteristics of AI-generated text versus human-written content.
